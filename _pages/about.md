# 🚩 Hi, there！

- I'm Yifan 😊. I am now a Research Associate 🧱 at the School of Airspace and Engineering, Shandong University.
- I obtained my Ph.D. degree at the 🏛️ School of Creative Technologies, University of Portsmouth, in Sept. 2021. Before that, I earned my master’s degree at the 🏛️ School of Computer Science and Technology, Ocean University of China, in June 2017. 

- My research interests 🎯 focus on Face Perception Computing, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_NIufakAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>.
- If you are seeking any form of cooperation 🙋, please feel free 🌈 to email me at 📩 xiayifan@sdu.edu.cn.
